      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="content-page">
	  Kernel density visualization (KDV) is a commonly used visualization tool for many data analytics tasks, including disease outbreak detection, crime hotspot detection, traffic accident hotspot detection, etc.  Besides the data analytics tasks, <a href = "http://drr.ikcest.org/knowledge_service/ncp.html"> IKCEST </a> utilizes the heatmap, based on KDV, to show the distribution of COVID-19 cases in different regions of China to the general public. Although the most popular geographical information systems, e.g., QGIS, and ArcGIS, can also support this operation, these solutions are not scalable to generate a single KDV for datasets with million-scale data points, let alone to support interactive KDV (e.g., zoom in, zoom out, and panning operations) in near real-time (< 5 sec). To address this issue, we develop the interactive visualization tool IKDV-SYS that is built on top of our prior study [1] on the efficient kernel density computation. IKDV-SYS can achieve near real-time performance to generate KDV on large-scale datasets (e.g., <a href = "https://data.ny.gov/browse"> New York traffic accident dataset </a> with 1.3 million data points), under the single CPU setting.
      </p>
      <h2>IKDV-SYS</h2>
	  <p class="content-page">
	  <!--This system can support different types of interactive visualization operations, e.g., zoom-in, panning etc, in nearly real-time for multiple users.-->
      IKDV-SYS can be used to perform hotspot detection in different types of applications, e.g., traffic accident hotspot detection [2], crime hotspot detection [3,4], and disease outbreak detection [5,6]. In the following, we show the example usages of IKDV-SYS to detect hotspots (geographical regions with red/orange color) in different applications. Here, we also show the visualization results after we perform the zoom in operation. Based on this operation, IKDV-SYS can detect different hotspots in different levels (e.g., city level, street level, etc.). <br> <br>

	  Compared with the state-of-the-art geographical information systems, e.g., <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_heatmap.html">QGIS</a>, and <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/kernel-density.htm">ArcGIS</a>, IKDV-SYS is the first web-based system, which can support:
	  </br>
	  <b>(1) the near real-time kernel density visualization in single machine setting without using GPU and parallel computation</b>
	  </br>
	  <b>(2) different types of interactive visualization operations, e.g., zoom-in, zoom-out, panning etc, in near real-time</b>
	  </br>
	  
	  We have released our <a href = "http://degroup.cis.um.edu.mo/covid-19/">system</a> (2<sup>nd</sup> version) to the general public. However, this is only the prototype in which we still need to refine it as better as possible. As such, we <b>disclaim any liability</b> in connection with the use of this system. In addition, since we cannot obtain the precise dataset for representing the COVID-19 cases, due to the privacy issue, the visualization in the city/street level is not accurate. As a remark, <b>this system is a technical demo. The result presented in this system is not a reliable indicator of COVID-19 cases.</b> Our demo paper is under submission to SIGMOD2021 (demo track) [7]. Hope that this paper can be accepted in this conference.
